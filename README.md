# FinalProjectSemesterB
This project is divided into two parts.

#Part 1: Fashion MNist
In this part we were required to work on a dataset named Fashion MNist
(see https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist).
Our task was to use dimensionality reduction methods such as PCA(Principal Component Analysis)
in order to take the most important features of the pictures(23 to 784).

#Part 2: Hands Check
In this part the dataset we had worked with described hand motions by frame.
The goal was to be able to distinguish between three states in which the hands are seen at:
1. Spontaneous.
2. Synchronized.
3. Alone.

The features the dataset includes are:
-Time
-Frame ID
-Hand Type
-Number Of Hands
-Position(X,Y,Z)
-Velocity(X,Y,Z)
-Pitch
-Roll
-Yaw
-Wrist Position(X,Y,Z)
-Elbow Position(X,Y,Z)
-Grab Strength
-Grab Angle
-Pinch Strength
